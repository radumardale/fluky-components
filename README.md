# fluky-components
Random bag of React Components.

This is another random set of React components. It's more of a playground for creating React components.

It follows [ps-react](https://github.com/coryhouse/ps-react) guidelines.

It uses:
 * [styled-components](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components) for styling
 * [ramda](https://github.com/ramda/ramda) as utilities library
 * [jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) for unit testing

**It is not intended for production. Most of the components will be opinionated - not highly customizable.**

Because of theming all the components are wrapped in a `styled-component`'s `ThemeProvider`.
