Random React components

This is a random set React components. It's more of a playground for creating React components.

It follows [ps-react](https://github.com/coryhouse/ps-react) guidelines.

It uses [styled-components](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components) for styling.

The finished product is not intended for production. Most of the components will be opinionated - not highly customizable.

Because of theming all the components are wrapped in a `styled-component`'s `ThemeProvider`.
